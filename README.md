# agent-skills-ts-template
Template for implementing skills / tools to an agent, by keeping skills in seperate folers.

A lightweight, production-ready TypeScript “Skills” framework you can drop into a Node/Edge/React app. It mirrors the Claude “skills” idea: modular, reusable capability packs that can auto-trigger based on user intent and then shape how your assistant behaves/structures outputs.

I’ll give you:

1. a tiny core library,

2. a filesystem/URL loader,

3. safety & observability hooks,

4. two example skills, and

5. quick usage in Node and React.
